INSTRUCTIONS

Save this file with a name like "FirstName LastName Solutions.sql"
(replacing "FirstName LastName" with your own name), and record your
solutions in here.

Before starting, record your name here, and the date when you began work on
the SQL course:

             Name: Kyle Flashman
Date/time started: 4/13/2022

Below, the file is divided into weeks, and each week is divided into
problems.  Please put your solution to each problem underneath the comment
that lists the problem number. We've included templates for the first
problems (#3-4) so you can see how we want them placed between the comments.

Note that all problem numbers from "More SQL Practice Problems" are prefixed
with "m", e.g., "m40", in this file. This is so we know at a glance which
problem you're solving. Please use this convention when asking for help.

Please leave all of our divider comments and USE statements intact and
unchanged. You're welcome to insert comments of your own in between, as long
as they aren't likely to be confused with our dividers.

Enjoy the course, and let us know if you have questions!
